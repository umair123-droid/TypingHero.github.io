Love for the country, in this case, might not converge with love for the government. The value of patriotism demands that the citizens love their country, remain loyal and committed to the development of the country. It is a feeling that should reside in the hearts of all the citizens of a country at all times. Whether this feeling of love, loyalty and commitment towards one's country reflect on the government, depends on its functioning and the credibility that the government enjoys among the citizens.",

We should remember that cleanliness is next to godliness.",
